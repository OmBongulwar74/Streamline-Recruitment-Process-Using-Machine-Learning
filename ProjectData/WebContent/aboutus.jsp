								<h1>About us</h1>
									<p><font color="#EAE8FF" >These days, an increasing number of businesses have begun making the transition from physical data rooms to virtual storage. In fact, one survey found that more than 50% of businesses use some form of cloud data storageâ€”and for good reason. Not only does virtual data storage save space, but it also makes for more convenient file access. Rather than having to dig through countless filing cabinets to locate a specific document, virtual data storage makes it possible to access digital files remotely, from the convenience of a personal computer or other electronic device.</p>
									<p>Data encryption is one of the most essential yet common types of security offered by a virtual data room. Essentially, the purpose of data encryption is to render sensitive information unreadable through the use of a special algorithm. For instance, when you upload a file to a virtual data room with encryption, the text within the file is automatically encrypted so that it's unreadable to the naked eye. In other words, it's translated into a special code that only the system has the capability (or "key") to crack. From there, the data can only be de-coded by another computer or user that also carries the "key" to do so.</font></p>
